## Use Cases

1. Extract molecular features (functional groups, chemical bonding and etc.) from given ``SMILE_str``.
2. Use various regression models to screen siginificant predictors from molecular features above that contribute to *PCE*.
3. Build up Artificial Neural Network(ANN) to connect selected molecular featrues and *PCE*.
4. (Future Work)Predict optimal structure that gives high PCE based on Terminal-Spacer-Core fragmented structures.
